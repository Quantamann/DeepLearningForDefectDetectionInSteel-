# DeepLearningForDefectDetectionInSteel

A deep learning project for automated defect detection and localization in steel manufacturing, using ResNet for classification and ResUNet for segmentation.

## Project Files

This repository contains the core code for our steel defect detection system. Due to size limitations, larger files and datasets are hosted on Google Drive:

## Attribution

The utility code used in the models has been sourced from existing implementations and was not developed by me. All source code is used in accordance with their respective licenses for educational and research purposes.

## Implementation Details

This project implements a two-stage approach:
1. ResNet classifier to detect the presence of defects
2. ResUNet segmentation model to localize defects at the pixel level
